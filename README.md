# **DyMMer-NFP** #

DyMMer-NFP tool, an extension of the DyMMer tool to support the modeling of NFPs and multiple contextual adaptation scenarios in feature models. DyMMer-NFP uses a catalog with 39 NFPs. Each NFP in this catalog were mapped according to each quality characteristic and sub-characteristics presented in the ISO/IEC 25010 SQuaRE product quality model. To specify the interdependencies between NFPs and features, DyMMer-NFP has used the concept of contribution links. In order to make it easier to evaluate DyMMer-NFP two datasets, called AFFOgaTO and ESPREssO, were made available for free.
