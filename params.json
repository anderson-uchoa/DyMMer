  "body": "**DyMMer** tool was developed to extract measures from different feature models, which can be described using the file format proposed by the S.P.L.O.T. feature models repository. The S.P.L.O.T. repository has over 600 models entered by SPL community to download, edit or product configuration. In S.P.L.O.T, a feature model is represented by a XML format and stored as a file. These files contain a header and the feature model relations (body). The header contains information about authorship, authorship contact and affiliation, besides the feature model creation date. However, the header information is not mandatory, it can be left in blank. The body of the file is mandatory and comprises the feature model structure and its integrity constraints. So, DyMMer receives as input XML files. The DyMMer process a feature model \fle and creates an in memory model that make possible to compute the quality measures values. Currently, DyMMer tool is able to collect 41 different quality measures in an automatic manner.\r\n\r\nDyMMer was created at Federal University of Ceará by Anderson Uchôa, Luan Lima and Holanda Freitas and is now jointly and openly managed by STRATEGy Group (SofTware Reuse and QuAliTy Group) at Federal University of Ceará, Quixadá, Brazil.\r\n\r\nDear academics/scientists, please cite DyMMer with the following bibliographical entry:\r\n\r\n@inproceedings{DyMMer,\r\n author = {Bezerra, Carla I.

Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nPersons involved in the development of DyMMER are:\r\n\r\nAnderson G. Uchôa (Federal University of Ceará, Brazil)\r\nLuan P. Lima (Federal University of Ceará, Brazil)\r\nCarla I. M. Bezerra (Federal University of Ceará, Brazil)\r\nJefferson Barbosa (Federal University of Ceará, Brazil)\r\nJoão Holanda Freires (Federal University of Ceará, Brazil)\r\nRossana M. C.
