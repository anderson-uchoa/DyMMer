# **DyMMer-NFP**

Modeling non-functional properties and multiple context adaptation scenarios in software product lines

### What is this ?

DyMMer-NFP tool is an extension of the DyMMer tool to support the modeling of NFPs and multiple contextual adaptation scenarios in feature models. DyMMer-NFP uses a catalog with 39 NFPs. Each NFP in this catalog were mapped according to each quality characteristic and sub-characteristics presented in the ISO/IEC 25010 SQuaRE product quality model. To specify the interdependencies between NFPs and features, DyMMer-NFP has used the concept of contribution links. In order to make it easier to evaluate DyMMer-NFP two datasets, called AFFOgaTO and ESPREssO, were made available for free.

DyMMer-NFP was created at Federal University of Ceará by Anderson Uchôa, Luan Lima with the supervision of Dra. Carla I. M. Bezerra and is now jointly and openly managed by STRATEGy Group (SofTware Reuse and QuAliTy Group) at Federal University of Ceará, Quixadá, Brazil.
